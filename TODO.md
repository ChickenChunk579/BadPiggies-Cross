# TODO #

- [ ] Fix the executable output path of our app bundle for Xcode; see **~/Notes/nomlib.md** for information on how to properly go about fixing this. In the mean time, the workaround is to copy the executable from **build/build/Debug-iphoneos** to **build/build**. Alternatively, you may edit the scheme from within XCode by telling it what executable to run with the Run action.

- [ ] FIXME notes in CMakeLists.txt
- [ ] Copy Resources folder over to app bundle
